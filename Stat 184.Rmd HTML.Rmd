## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r,echo=TRUE}
# Example code for diamond pricing analysis
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Load diamond dataset
diamonds_data <- diamonds

# Data visualization - Price vs. Carat
ggplot(diamonds_data, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Diamond Price vs. Carat",
       x = "Carat",
       y = "Price")

# Summary table
summary_table <- diamonds_data %>%
  group_by(cut) %>%
  summarise(Mean_Price = mean(price),
            Median_Price = median(price),
            Max_Price = max(price))


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{# I learned about the syntax for R-studio as well as the basics of how to code using it}
# I have also learned about  data visualizations and the right way to create them.
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
